# Log Parsing Project

This project consists of a Python script (`0-stats.py`) for parsing log data from standard input. The log data is generated by another script (`0-generator.py`) in a specific format. The primary goal of the script is to compute and print statistics based on the log data.

## Requirements

- Allowed Editors: vi, vim, emacs
- Interpreted/Compiled on Ubuntu 20.04 LTS using Python 3.4.3
- PEP 8 style (version 1.7.x) should be followed
- All files must be executable
- A README.md file is mandatory

## Usage

1. Execute the log data generator script:

    ```bash
    ./0-generator.py | ./0-stats.py
    ```

2. The script reads the log data line by line and computes metrics.
3. After every 10 lines or a keyboard interruption (CTRL + C), it prints the following statistics:
   - Total file size
   - Number of lines by status code (200, 301, 400, 401, 403, 404, 405, 500)

## Example Output

```bash
File size: 5213
200: 2
401: 1
403: 2
404: 1
405: 1
500: 3
File size: 11320
200: 3
301: 2
400: 1
401: 2
403: 3
404: 4
405: 2
500: 3
...
