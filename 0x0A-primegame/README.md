# Prime Game

## Description
This project implements a Python function to determine the winner of a game based on prime numbers. The game involves two players, Maria and Ben, who take turns choosing prime numbers from a given set of consecutive integers starting from 1 up to a specified maximum number. The player who cannot make a move loses the game. The function simulates multiple rounds of the game, determining the winner for each round.

## Files
- `0-prime_game.py`: Contains the Python implementation of the `isWinner` function to determine the winner of the prime game.
- `main_0.py`: A sample script demonstrating the usage of the `isWinner` function.

## Requirements
- Allowed editors: vi, vim, emacs
- All files are interpreted/compiled on Ubuntu 20.04 LTS using Python 3.4.3
- All files should end with a new line
- The first line of all files should be exactly `#!/usr/bin/python3`
- A README.md file, at the root of the folder of the project, is mandatory
- Code should follow the PEP 8 style (version 1.7.x)
- All files must be executable

## Usage
To determine the winner of the prime game, execute the `main_0.py` script with the desired parameters:
